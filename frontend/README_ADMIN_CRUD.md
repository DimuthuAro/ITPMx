## Technical Implementation

### Form Components

- Form validation and error handling
- Conditional rendering for edit/create modes

### State Management

- Controlled forms for input handling
- Real-time UI updates after CRUD operations

### API Integration
- Full backend API integration for all CRUD operations
- Error handling for API calls
- Consistent data structure across all entities

## Styling
- Modern, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Consistent color scheme for status indicators
- Responsive tables with proper formatting for all screen sizes

## Usage

Navigate to the admin panel at `/admin` to access all CRUD functionality. Use the sidebar to switch between different entity management screens.

## Security Considerations

This implementation assumes authentication has been removed as requested. In a production environment, proper authentication and authorization should be implemented to secure access to the admin panel and its features.
